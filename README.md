# NUMBER-RECOGNITION

- Initially a Racket script that measured and compared the Euclidian
distance between given handwritten digits and a set of training data to return the closest match.
- Converted to a Python application using the MNIST database to learn and Matplotlib to visualize.
- Two approaches implemented â€“ Simple approach with a trained Scikit-Learn Neural Network, and a Gradient/ 
Backpropagation approach using NumPy to manually train a small network and predict results.
